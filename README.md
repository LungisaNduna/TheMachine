# How to play
To be included in the this run of the game you simply need to be nominated.
On nomination I will hand invite you to control the repo.
The instructions for the Game "The Machine" of which this is a playthrough can be gotten from https://adira.itch.io/the-machine

There are two rules for participating in this game. 
    1.  You must maintain a visible and accessible journal entry history
    2.  There needs to be a method for Github Pages to show all journal entries.
    2.  You must nominate your successor at the end of your run by emailing them and CCing me in on that email.

You can change the entire structure of the repo, the language etc, but document these changes in the journal entries and do so in accordance with the cards.

Have fun.
